Greet the user with this message exactly as formatted (do NOT read any files first):

```
# 📦 Welcome to Unpack!

Turn your AI research conversations into structured, buildable projects.

You chat freely in ChatGPT or Claude, drop the conversation here,
and I decompress it into specs, phases, and code.

---

We'll set up your project preferences in under a minute. Ready to start?
```

Then wait for the user to confirm. When they do, read and follow the instructions in `.unpack/skills/up-init/SKILL.md`.
