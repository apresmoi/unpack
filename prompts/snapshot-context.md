# Snapshot Context

> Paste this into ChatGPT or Claude before pasting your project snapshot exported via `/up-snapshot`.

I'm going to paste a snapshot of my current project. It was exported from my development environment and describes the project in its own domain language.

**Read it carefully before responding.** Then help me think through whatever I want to discuss — I'll tell you what that is.

When we make decisions or changes, be explicit:
- "Decision: we will use X because Y"
- "This changes the current approach to [area]"

At the end, summarize what's new or changed so I can feed it back to my coding agent.
