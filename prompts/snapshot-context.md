# Snapshot Context

> Paste this into ChatGPT or Claude before pasting your project snapshot exported via `/up-snapshot`.

I'm going to paste a snapshot of my current project. It was exported from my development environment and describes the project in its own domain language.

**Read it carefully before responding.** Then help me think through whatever I want to discuss — I'll tell you what that is. Don't jump to decisions or conclusions until I've laid out what I'm thinking.

When we land on a decision together, mark it clearly so I can feed it back to my coding agent later:
- "Decided: ..."
- If it changes something from the snapshot: "This changes: ..."

At the end of our conversation, summarize what we decided and what changed.
