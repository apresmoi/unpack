# Adoption rules

## What "adoption" means

We are documenting and improving a codebase that already exists.

## Inference policy

- Anything derived from code without confirmation is labeled **inferred**.
- Inferred facts must be confirmed with the user before becoming "spec truth".

## No refactors during bootstrap

Phase-0 produces docs + plan. Refactors start in later phases.

## Align-to-health goals

Adoption phases should converge toward:
- reproducible local run
- clear commands for test/lint/typecheck
- minimal CI gates
- stable architecture boundaries
- docs/specs that match reality
